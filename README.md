## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2022 to better understand:

1. What's the most popular method of learning to code?
2. What are the most commonly used programming languages among developers?
3. Which countries have the highest average developer salaries?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheemanthbhat/stack-overflow-annual-developer-survey-2022). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
